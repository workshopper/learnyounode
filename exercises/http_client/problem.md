Write a program that performs an HTTP GET request to a URL provided to you as the first command-line argument. Write the String contents of **each** "data" event from the response to a new line on the console (stdout).

## HINTS

For this exercise you will need to use the `http` core module.

Documentation on the `http` module can be found by pointing your browser here:
  {rootdir:/node_apidoc/http.html}

The `http.get()` method is a shortcut for simple GET requests, use it to simplify your solution. The first argument to `http.get()` can be the URL you want to GET, provide a callback as the second argument.

Unlike other callback functions, this one has the signature:

```js
function callback (response) { /* ... */ }
```

Where the `response` object is a Node **Stream** object. You can treat Node Streams as objects that emit events, the three events that are of most interest are: "data", "error" and "end". You listen to an event like so:

```js
stream.on("data", function (data) { /* ... */ })
```

The "data" is emitted when a chunk of data is available and can be processed. The size of the chunk depends upon the underlying data source.

The `response` object / Stream that you get from `http.get()` also has a `setEncoding()` method. If you call this method with "utf8", the "data" events will emit Strings rather than the standard Node `Buffer` objects which you have to explicitly convert to Strings.
