Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make Node.js program, create a new file with a `.js` extension and start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
`node` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ node myprogram.js
```

You can write to the console in the same way as in the browser:

```js
console.log("text")
```

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify myprogram.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
