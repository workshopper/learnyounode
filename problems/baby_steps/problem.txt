Write a program that accepts one or more numbers as command-line
arguments and prints the sum of those numbers to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

You can access command-line arguments via the in-built `process`
object. The `process` object has an `argv` property which is an array
containing the complete command-line. i.e. `process.argv`.

However, the first element of this array is {italic}always{/italic} 'node' and
the second element is {italic}always{/italic} the path to your program.js file. So you
will need to start at the 3rd element (index 2) when looking for
additional command-line arguments.

As an experiment. Try making a program that simply contains:
  console.log(process.argv)
and then run it with `node myprogram.js` and any number of additional
arguments.

Also be aware that all elements of `process.argv` are strings and you
may need to {italic}coerce{/italic} them into numbers. You can do this by prefixing the
property with `+` or passing it to `Number()`. e.g. `+process.argv[2]`
or `Number(process.argv[2])`.
