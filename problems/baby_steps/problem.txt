Write a program that accepts one or more numbers as command-line
arguments and prints the sum of those numbers to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

You can access command-line arguments via the in-built `process`
object. The `process` object has an `argv` property which is an array
containing the complete command-line. i.e. `process.argv`.

To get things started, write a program that simply contains:
  console.log(process.argv)
Run it with `node myprogram.js` and numbers as arguments. For example:
  $ node myprogram.js 1 2 3
In which case the output would be an array looking something like:
  [ 'node', '/path/to/your/program.js', '1', '2', '3' ]
  
Keep in mind that you won't be adding those arguments when you run
your program with 'learnyounode run program.js' or 
'learnyounode verify program.js' because the test environment will be
generating the arguments.
  
You'll need to think about how to loop through the number arguments so 
you can output their sum. The first element of the process.argv array
is always 'node', and the second element is always the path to your 
program.js file, so you need to start at the 3rd element (index 2), 
adding each item to the total until you reach the end of the array.

Also be aware that all elements of `process.argv` are strings and you
may need to coerce them into numbers. You can do this by prefixing the
property with `+` or passing it to `Number()`. e.g. `+process.argv[2]`
or `Number(process.argv[2])`.
