Write an HTTP {bold}server{/bold} that receives only POST requests and converts
incoming POST body characters to upper-case and returns it to the
client.

Your server should listen on {bold}port 8000{/bold}.

HINTS:

While you're not restricted to using the streaming capabilities of the
`request` and `response` objects, it will be much easier if you do.

There are a number of different packages in npm that you can use to
{italic}"transform"{/italic} stream data as it's passing through. For this exercise
the `through2-map` package offers the simplest API.

`through2-map` allows you to create a {italic}transform stream{/italic} using
only a single function that takes a chunk of data and returns a chunk
of data. It's designed to work much like `Array#map()` but for
streams:

  var map = require('through2-map')
  inStream.pipe(map(function (chunk) {
    return chunk.toString().split('').reverse().join('')
  })).pipe(outStream)

In the above example, the incoming data from `inStream` is converted
to a String (if it isn't already), the characters are reversed and the
result is passed through to `outStream`. So we've made a chunk
character reverser! Remember though that the chunk size is determined
up-stream and you have little control over it for incoming data.

To install `through2-map` type:
  npm install through2-map

If you don't have an Internet connection, simply make a `node_modules`
directory and copy the entire directory for the module you want to use
from inside the {appname} installation directory:
  {rootdir:/node_modules/through2-map}
