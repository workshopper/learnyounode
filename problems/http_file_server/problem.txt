Write an HTTP {bold}server{/bold} that serves the same text file for each request
it receives.

You will be provided with the location of the file to serve as the
first command-line argument. You {bold}must{/bold} use the `fs.createReadStream()`
method to stream the file contents to the response.

Your server should listen on {bold}port 8000{/bold}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS:

The `http` core module has a method named `http.createServer()` that
takes a callback function. Unlike most callbacks in Node, the callback
used by `createServer()` is called more than once. Every connection
received by your server triggers another call to the callback. The
callback function has the signature:

  function (request, response) { ... }

Where the two arguments are objects representing the HTTP request
and the corresponding response for this request. `request` is used to
fetch properties, such as the header and query-string from the request
while `response` if for sending data to the client, both headers and
body.

Both `request` and `response` are also Node streams! Which means that
you can use the streaming abstractions to send and receive data if
they suit your use-case.

`http.createServer()` also returns an instance of your `server`. You
must call `server.listen(portNumber)` to start listening on a
particular port.

A typical Node HTTP server looks like this:

  var http = require('http')
  var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    // request handling logic...
  })
  server.listen(8000)

Documentation on the `http` module can be found by pointing your
browser here:
  {rootdir}/node_apidoc/http.html

The `fs` core module also has some streaming APIs for files. You will
need to use `fs.createReadStream()` method to create a stream
representing the file you are given as a command-line argument. The
method returns a stream object which you can use `src.pipe(dst)` to
pipe the data from the `src` stream to the `dst` stream. In this way
you can connect a filesystem stream with an HTTP response stream.
