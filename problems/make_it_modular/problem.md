This problem is the same as the previous but introduces the concept of **modules**. You will need to create two files to solve this.

Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory, filtered by the extension of the files. The first argument is the directory name and the second argument is the extension filter. Print the list of files (one file per line) to the console. You **must** use asynchronous I/O.

You must write a *module* file to do most of the work. The module must *export* a single function that takes **three** arguments: the directory name, the filename extension string and a callback function. The filename extension argument must be the same as was passed to your program. i.e. don't turn it in to a RegExp or prefix with "." or do anything else but pass it to your module where you can do what you need to make your filter work.

The callback function must be called using the idiomatic node(err, data) convention. This convention stipulates that unless there's an error, the first argument passed to the callback will be null, and the second will be your data. In this case the data will be your filtered list of files, as an Array. If you receive an error, e.g. from your call to  `fs.readdir()`, the callback must be called with the error, and only the error, as the first argument.

You **must** not print directly to the console from your module file, only from your original program.

In the case of an error bubbling up to your original program file, simply check for it and print an informative message to the console.

## HINTS

Create a new module by creating a new file that just contains your directory reading and filtering function. To define a *single function* *export* you assign your function to the `module.exports` object, overwriting what is already there:

```js
module.exports = function (args) { /* ... */ }
```

Or you can use a named function and assign the name.

To use your new module in your original program file, use the `require()` call in the same way that you `require('fs')` to load the `fs` module. The only difference is that for local modules must be prefixed with './'. So, if your file is named mymodule.js then:

```js
var mymodule = require('./mymodule.js')
```

The '.js' is optional here and you will often see it omitted.

You now have the `module.exports` object in your module assigned to the `mymodule` variable. Since you are exporting a single function, `mymodule` is a function you can call!

Also keep in mind that it is idiomatic to check for errors and do early-returns within callback functions:

```js
function bar (callback) {
  foo(function (err, data) {
    if (err)
      return callback(err) // early return

    // ... no error, continue doing cool things with `data`

    // all went well, call callback with `null` for the error argument

    callback(null, data)
  })
}
```
